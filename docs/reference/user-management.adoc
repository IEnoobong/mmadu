== Overview

Mmadu User Service is an independent service for managing users. It exposes the following resources
for managing users:

. AppDomains - This is a tenant, with its own users, groups, roles and authorities.
. AppUsers - Representing users of client applications. Users can have custom properties defined by the domain.
. Roles and Authorities - Enforcable user privileges.
. Groups - Objects used to further categorize users in a tree hierarchy.

== Features

Currently, mmadu user service provides the following:

. Resource Management - Management of domains, users, roles, authorities and groups
. Authentication - Provides an api that clients can use to Authenticate their users.
. Password Hashing - Passwords of users are hashed and cannot be decrypted.

== Default Configuration

=== Default Port

Mmadu User Service listens to port 15551 by default and this can be configured using the SERVER_PORT environment variable
or the server.port SpringBoot property.

== Managing Domains

A domain is analogous to a realm. This represents a user pool with its own set of users, groups, roles, and authorities.

A client application references users in one domain. A domain is referenced by a domain id. Applications
can share the same user base by using the same domain id.

=== Setting Up A Domain

With one API call, you can set up users, roles, authorities and groups needed for your domain. Domain configuration is done
with a call to `POST /domains`.

Authority: `domain.initialize`
