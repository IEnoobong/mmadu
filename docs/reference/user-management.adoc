== Overview

Mmadu User Service is an independent service for managing users. It exposes the following resources
for managing users:

. AppDomains - This is a tenant, with its own users, groups, roles and authorities.
. AppUsers - Representing users of client applications. Users can have custom properties defined by the domain.
. Roles and Authorities - Enforcable user privileges.
. Groups - Objects used to further categorize users in a tree hierarchy.

== Features

Currently, mmadu user service provides the following:

. Resource Management - Management of domains, users, roles, authorities and groups
. Authentication - Provides an api that clients can use to Authenticate their users.
. Password Hashing - Passwords of users are hashed and cannot be decrypted.

== Default Configuration

=== Default Port

Mmadu User Service listens to port 15551 by default and this can be configured using the SERVER_PORT environment variable
or the server.port SpringBoot property.

== Managing Domains

A domain is analogous to a realm. This represents a user pool with its own set of users, groups, roles, and authorities.

A client application references users in one domain. A domain is referenced by a domain id. Applications
can share the same user base by using the same domain id.

=== Setting Up A Domain

With one API call, you can set up users, roles, authorities and groups needed for your domain. Domain configuration is done
with a call to `POST /domains`.

Authority: `domain.initialize`

==== Domain Setup Request Fields

=== Registration Service

The registration service provides an api to access the registration page for a domain. The registration page
generates a form from the configured fields and field types of a domain.

==== Displaying the registration form

The registration form can be accessed in the browser using the url:

----
http://[registration-host]:[registration-port]/[domain-id]/register
----

For example, accessing the default domain with the default configuration can be done
by entering the url below on your browser.

----
http://localhost:1552/0/register
----

The registration services redirects to the defaultRedirectionUrl specified in the registration profile for
this domain. To specify a url to redirect to, add the redirectUrl parameter

----
http://localhost:1552/0/register?redirectUrl=http://myapp.com
----
==== Customizing Registration Forms

Registration forms for a domain can be customized by adding and removing fields and field types.
The registration service ensures that form fields are created for each field.

==== Registration Profiles

Each domain has a registration profile object that is used for configuring the applications behaviour during
registration.

NOTE: There can be only one registration profile for a domain.

===== Creating a Registration Profile

A POST Request will create a registration profile.

[#defining-markup-for-fields]
==== Defining Markup for Fields

You define how you want your registration fields by configuring fields and field types. The markup property in
the field type is used to define the markup of that specific field type. An age field type markup can be defined
as shown:

[source,html]
----
<label for='$field.name' class='sr-only'>$field.label</label>
<input type='number' id='$field.name' name='$field.name' class='form-control'
placeholder='$field.placeholder' $maxValue $minValue autofocus $required $inputField $inputStyle $errorStyle >
$errorDisplay"
----

Mmadu registration service uses apache velocity to generate markup for fields. It provies the following in
the template context for use in defining fields. You reference context objects by adding the `$` prefix. For example,
the `$field.name` returns the name property in the field object.

|===
|Object Name |Description

|field
|The field object

|type
|The field type object

|inputField
|Input attribute and value that marks an element as a model input

|inputStyle
|style attribute, any element with this property will have the field type style property appended to that element

|errorStyle
|style attribute, any element with this property will have the style appended with the error style when the field contains errors

|errorDisplay
|HTML markup for displaying field errors

|maxValue
|max attribute, any element with this will have the max attribute set to the max value of the field type

|minValue
|min attribute, any element with this will have the min attribute set to the min value of the field type
